# CustomerServiceChat

Much code, which includes the code for serverThread extends thread and 
clientThread extends thread, was taken from a college class. 

CustomerServiceServer and CustomerServiceClient applications allow communication between a 
server (representative) and client. 

server:
Clicking 'Next Client' will initiate the chat between server and client. 
If no clients are waiting to talk to the server(representative), then 
clicking 'Next Client' will display "No clients waiting" in the server GUI. 
TextField NumClientsWaiting in the server GUI does not always show the correct 
amount of clients waiting. 

client:
Once application started, client must wait for server to start 
the session. Once session is started, client can send messages 
to server.

Functionality issues remain in the project.
